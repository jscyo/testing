iFor this task, you will be building UI for the site-wide warning bar in an existing web app, along with an admin console for admins to turn warnings on and off. The mock ups are at this Figma link.

A user must be able to dismiss the current ongoing warning. If a warning is updated to a different type, the user should see the new warning. Similarly, if a user dismissed the current warning, but it's ended, and a new warning starts, they should see the new warning.

A warning consists of at least two fields:

type: SiteWideWarningType
label: String

There are three types of warnings:

    Download Server Unavailable Warning
    Upload Server Unavailable Warning
    Data Inconsistency Warning

Each type of warning has it's own hardcoded label which you can find in the Figma link attached above.

Note 1: You don't need to make server side changes, all changes should be in the client subfolder. It's expected that in-app state changes won't persist after you refresh the page.

Note 2: No more than one Site Wide Warning can be ongoing at the same time.

Steps:

    Set up your local dev environment first. Refer to the set up instructions in the README.
    Seed your database with a few users. This is necessary to test user-level warning dismissal. Refer to the data seeding instructions in the README.
    Build your solution in client.
    Log key events (ie: warning created, warning dismissed, etc) using the provided logger util. The more thorough your logs are, the better.

You are allowed to edit, remove, or add any file in this repository to complete the task.
